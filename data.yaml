about: |
  My journey in the IT field started in my second year of university. As part of the curriculum, all students are required to 
  participate in an internship. Since I didn't want to do the internship through the university, I decided to take part in a 
  selection test held by a local company. After the test, I was disappointed because I thought I hadn't performed well. 
  However, two or three hours later, I received a call saying, "Congratulations, you passed the test, and if you'd like, 
  we can schedule an interview." Everything went well, and I got the job. After three years, I decided to explore a new 
  path in my career and applied for a DevOps internship at a larger company. The interview process was very interesting. 
  Although I couldn't answer every question, one topic I struggled with was cloud technologies. However, most of the questions 
  were related to programming and my performance on the test. I did well during the internship, but unfortunately, I wasn't 
  able to secure a job offer. The following year, I secured another internship, this time with a bit more experience under 
  my belt, and I eventually landed my first full-time DevOps role. Now, given the changing job market, I've also subscribed 
  to DataCamp to learn more about data science and possibly AI.
