about: |
  My journey in the IT field started in my second year of university. As part of the curriculum, all students are required to 
  participate in an internship. Since I didn't want to do the internship through the university, I decided to take part in a 
  selection test held by a local company. After the test, I was disappointed because I thought I hadn't performed well. 
  However, two or three hours later, I received a call saying, "Congratulations, you passed the test, and if you'd like, 
  we can schedule an interview." Everything went well, and I got the job. After three years, I decided to explore a new 
  path in my career and applied for a DevOps internship at a larger company. The interview process was very interesting. 
  Although I couldn't answer every question, one topic I struggled with was cloud technologies. However, most of the questions 
  were related to programming and my performance on the test. I did well during the internship, but unfortunately, I wasn't 
  able to secure a job offer. The following year, I secured another internship, this time with a bit more experience under 
  my belt, and I eventually landed my first full-time DevOps role. Now, given the changing job market, I've also subscribed 
  to DataCamp to learn more about data science and possibly AI.

      and Jenkins. During the internship, I applied and enhanced that knowledge through practice. I was working for Dockerfile, 
      Jenkins pipeline that built and pushed the image in ECS and after deploying the on ECS or EKS. Also, I developed a cron pipeline 
      that creates/destroys the infrastructure written using Terraform IaC.

      Gained practical experience in software development using C/C++ (mostly based on standard 11). I was using external libraries such 
      as Boost. Also, I learned how to structure and use package managers such as CMake or Conan for building and managing dependencies. 
      Besides those, I was learning the basics of Linux and how to connect to MariaDB using C++ connectors. At the end of the practice, 
      I developed a project that used all the learned technologies.

      This is a simple flow of DevOps on GCP. In GCP is running a GKE cluster. For CI/CD is used Google Cloud build. 
      Based on cloud build a docker image is created and uploaded on Artifactory Repository and the new images is used to create 
      the deployment on each environment.

      Create a Kubernetes cluster on Digital Ocean using Terraform and Ansible. The Kubernetes cluster is formed by three droplets. 
      One of the droplets is used as a control plane or master of the cluster and the others are used as worker nodes. At the end 
      of the video, I display the cluster nodes and run a sample pod with the Nginx image.
